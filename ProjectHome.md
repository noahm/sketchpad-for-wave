**Sketchpad for Wave** is a gadget for Google Wave that emulates the functionality of MS Paint using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. Based on [CanvasPaint](http://canvaspaint.org/) by Christopher Clay which he [released to the public domain](http://canvaspaint.org/blog/2008/02/code-released-into-public-domain/)

Currently only tested in Firefox 3.5 and confirmed not to work in Safari or Google Chrome (yet). You can check it out in action at [the official Sketchpad Google Wave thread](https://wave.google.com/wave/?nouacheck#restored:wave:googlewave.com!w%252BS4F1AzTRA). (Google Wave account is required, of course.)
